To kickstart your journey in this course, your initial step is to clone the [`vtex.service-example`](https://github.com/vtex-apps/service-example) boilerplate app. This repository serves as a template with all the essential files you need to get started in this course.

<CH.Scrollycoding>

## Cloning the boilerplate repository

Clone the `vtex-apps/service-example` boilerplate by running the command presented on the right panel. This will create a local copy of the project, equipping you with the necessary files to start the course.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vtex-apps/service-example
```

## Understanding the project structure

Open the [service-example](https://github.com/vtex-apps/service-example) project in the code editor of your preference. Note that the project contains the `/node` and `/docs` directories, the `manifest.json` file, and the `package.json` file.

```txt
root
 ┣ 📂 node
 ┣ 📂 docs
 ┣ 📄 README.md
 ┣ 📄 manifest.json
 ┗ 📄 package.json
```

---

### `manifest.json` file

At the heart of this structure lies the [`manifest.json`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-manifest) file, a crucial document encapsulating metadata about the app. This file not only contains fundamental details such as the app's `name`, `version`, and `title` but also outlines the `builders`, `policies`, and `dependencies` necessary for the app functionality. Let's delve deeper into some of these concepts:

| Field | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
|`builders` | `object` | Specifies the [builders](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-builders) required by the app. Note that the app uses the `node` builder, responsible for interpreting [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) code. For each declared builder, there will be a dedicated folder specifically designed to be interpreted by that particular builder. |
| `policies` | `array` | Declares [policies](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-policies) for accessing external services or specific resources needed for the app functioning. |

```

## `node` folder

The `/node` folder contains the backend logic of the app, written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Here, Node packages and native libraries, such as [`@vtex/clients`](https://github.com/vtex/io-clients), can be employed to enhance code development.

Within the `node` folder, you will also find the following folders and files:

| Folder or file | Description |
| - | - |
| `/middlewares` | Folder containing middleware functions. |
| `/middlewares/validate.ts` | Middleware that validates if the request has a valid HTTP status code. It will also be used to access the app authentication token. |
| `/middlewares/status.ts` | Middleware to call the VTEX Commerce API and fetch SKU details from the Catalog API. |
| `/clients` | Folder where the Clients of the app are defined, used to access external resources and services. |
| `/clients/index.ts` | Definition of the `Clients` class. Here we will import the Client `Catalog` and define a getter/setter function for Catalog items. |
| `index.ts` | Initial declarations for the app's functionality, including mapping routes and middlewares. |
| `package.json` | Metadata about the node app, including its name, version, description, dependencies, and scripts. |
| `service.json` | Configuration file that specifies the the app's infrastructure attributes. It includes details such as memory allocation, timeout duration, minimum and maximum replicas, and routes. |
| `tsconfig.json` | Configuration file for TypeScript, specifying how the TypeScript compiler should compile the project. It may include options such as the target JavaScript version, module system, and other compiler settings. |

### `node/service.json` file

Located within the `/node` folder, the [`service.json`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-service) file configures the app's infrastructure attributes. Key details are summarized in the following table:

| Field | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `memory` | `integer` | Memory size allocated to the app, in megabytes. This value is subjective to automatic adjustments if excessive usage is detected. |
| `timeout` | `integer` | Maximum duration for fulfilling a request, in seconds. Requests exceeding this timeout are aborted. |
| `minReplicas` | `integer` | Minimum number of replicas available when the app is operational. |
| `maxReplicas` | `integer` | Maximum numbers of replicas available for the app. |
| `routes` | `object` | Describes the app's REST routes. Note that a public route named `status` with the path `/_v/status/:code` is already defined. |

```json node/service.json mark=8:13
{
  "memory": 256,
  "ttl": 10,
  "timeout": 2,
  "minReplicas": 2,
  "maxReplicas": 4,
  "workers": 1,
  "routes": {
    "status": {
      "path": "/_v/status/:code",
      "public": true
    }
  }
}
```

---

### `node/index.ts` file

The `node/index.ts` file associates routes with middlewares. Note that the `routes` section associates the `status` route with the GET method and the `validate` and `status` middleware functions.

This means that when a GET request is made to the `status` route, the app will trigger the `validate` and `status` middleware functions in the specified order.

> Check the `middlewares/status.ts` and `middlewares/validate.ts` files to better understand the functions exposed by this service.

```ts node/index.ts mark=5:6,52:54
import type { ClientsConfig, ServiceContext, RecorderState } from '@vtex/api'
import { LRUCache, method, Service } from '@vtex/api'

import { Clients } from './clients'
import { status } from './middlewares/status'
import { validate } from './middlewares/validate'

const TIMEOUT_MS = 800

// Create a LRU memory cache for the Status client.
// The 'max' parameter sets the size of the cache.
// The @vtex/api HttpClient respects Cache-Control headers and uses the provided cache.
// Note that the response from the API being called must include an 'etag' header
// or a 'cache-control' header with a 'max-age' value. If neither exist, the response will not be cached.
// To force responses to be cached, consider adding the `forceMaxAge` option to your client methods.
const memoryCache = new LRUCache<string, any>({ max: 5000 })

metrics.trackCache('status', memoryCache)

// This is the configuration for clients available in `ctx.clients`.
const clients: ClientsConfig<Clients> = {
  // We pass our custom implementation of the clients bag, containing the Status client.
  implementation: Clients,
  options: {
    // All IO Clients will be initialized with these options, unless otherwise specified.
    default: {
      retries: 2,
      timeout: TIMEOUT_MS,
    },
    // This key will be merged with the default options and add this cache to our Status client.
    status: {
      memoryCache,
    },
  },
}

declare global {
  // We declare a global Context type just to avoid re-writing ServiceContext<Clients, State> in every handler and resolver
  type Context = ServiceContext<Clients, State>

  // The shape of our State object found in `ctx.state`. This is used as state bag to communicate between middlewares.
  interface State extends RecorderState {
    code: number
  }
}

// Export a service that defines route handlers and client options.
export default new Service({
  clients,
  routes: {
    // `status` is the route ID from service.json. It maps to an array of middlewares (or a single handler).
    status: method({
      GET: [validate, status],
    }),
  },
})
```

## Testing the `/status` route

Change to the app directory and link it to a development workspace. This action will prompt the availability of the `/status` route. To verify its functionality, make a request to `https://{workspace}--{accountName}.myvtex.com/_v/status/200`, replacing `{workspace}` and `{accountName}` according to your scenario.

<CH.Code>

```sh
cd services-example && vtex link
```
