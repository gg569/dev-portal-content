A Pixel app is a specialized application that connects your VTEX store to third-party services by automatically injecting necessary scripts and configurations into your store's pages. This integration allows for data collection and interaction with external services like analytics and user support platforms, without the need for manual script management.

After installation, the Pixel app automatically injects the necessary tracking scripts and, when applicable, custom JavaScript configurations into your store’s pages, ensuring that the integrated third-party solutions work as expected.

Examples of native Pixel apps include: [Facebook](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.facebook-pixel/), [Google Tag Manager](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.google-tag-manager/) and [Zendesk Chat](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.zendesk-chat/).

> ℹ️ For a full list of native Pixel apps, refer to the [Pixel Apps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/pixel-apps/) documentation.
