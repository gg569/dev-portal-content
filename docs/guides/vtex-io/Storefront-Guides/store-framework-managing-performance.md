The performance of your website directly impacts overall business success. Fast-loading websites provide a smoother shopping experience, keep users engaged, and reduce bounce rates. In contrast, poor performance, such as slow load times, may frustrate users and result in lost sales.

Site performance is also a key factor in SEO rankings, influencing organic traffic and search engine visibility. Learn more in the [SEO](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/storefront-seo) guide.

In this section, you will learn how to optimize your website performance by configuring key settings in your Store Framework store.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Have a store using Store Framework

Ensure your store has a [Store Theme](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-store-theme) developed following the [Storefront](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/getting-started-3) guide.

Customize your store theme based on your business needs by following the guides within the [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework) section, such as the guides [Building pages](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework-building-pages) and [Using components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework-using-components).

### Check the builders

Check if the builders are properly installed in your Store Theme. To use builders, your account must have at least version `vtex.builder-hub@0.293.4` installed. Also, you need to specify them in the app's `manifest.json` file. Learn more in [Builders](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-builders).

### Learn about performance best practices

Familiarize yourself with the best practices and tools for optimizing your store performance. Learn more in the [Performance](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/storefront-performance) guide.
