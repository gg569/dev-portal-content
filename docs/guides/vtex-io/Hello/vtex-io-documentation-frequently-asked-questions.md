This FAQ provides detailed information on VTEX IO and the VTEX IO Store Framework, covering their usage, access requirements, cost, and support options.

## VTEX IO

### What can I develop with VTEX IO?

VTEX IO enables you to build:

- **Storefront apps:** Design tailored storefront components with React.
- **Admin apps:** Extend your store's admin capabilities with additional applications.
- **Backend apps:** Create backend services for integration with Storefront or Admin apps, using Node or .NET Core.
- **Pixel apps:** Develop pixel apps to gather user data for integration with third-party services.

### Who can use VTEX IO?

VTEX IO access is generally limited to a small group of developers as a closed beta, except for custom storefront apps.

- **Closed beta access:** To join the closed beta for project types like Admin, backend, and pixel, you must meet one of the following criteria:
  - Enterprise VTEX Accounts: Users on an Enterprise plan can verify eligibility based on their contract.
  - Partners: VTEX IO-certified development partners are eligible for closed beta access.
- **Storefront apps:** All VTEX accounts and partners can develop storefront apps without restrictions. This option allows you to build React-based storefronts to suit your specific business needs, regardless of your VTEX plan or certification status.

### I meet all the necessary prerequisites. What do I need to do to start developing?

If you meet the prerequisites for closed beta access, complete the [Application form](https://forms.gle/f7bYdTA7tfdfB5tt7) with your project details. Review the guidelines on [filling out the application form for development](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-filling-the-application-form-for-development/) to ensure you meet all criteria.

> **Note:** No application is needed to develop storefront apps.

### How much does it cost?

Currently, developing on VTEX IO does not incur additional fees.

### What type of support is available?

Custom apps are the responsibility of their developers. VTEX does not provide support for custom apps.

## VTEX IO Store Framework

### What are the advantages of building with the Store Framework?

The Store Framework is designed to reduce time-to-market, lower maintenance costs, and provide extensive customization options for storefront development. It is backed by an active developer community that contributes enhancements to store blocks, fostering scalable and customizable storefronts.

### Can I customize Store Framework blocks?

Yes, Store Framework blocks are designed with flexibility in mind. Each block comes with configurable properties and CSS Handles, allowing you to adapt styling and behavior to match your brand and design requirements, making it easier to build a distinct store identity and streamline implementation time.

For more complex needs, custom apps and components can be created. However, note that VTEX does not provide support for third-party apps; the app vendor is responsible for maintaining and supporting these custom solutions.

### Who can use Store Framework?

All VTEX accounts can use Store Framework, as it is available in open beta. However, as an open-source project in active development, expect ongoing updates and improvements.

### How much does Store Framework cost?

The Store Framework is included by default in VTEX contracts, with no additional cost for clients.

### What support is available for Store Framework?

VTEX provides support for all native Store Framework blocks, so any issues related to these blocks can be resolved by opening a [support ticket](https://help-tickets.vtex.com/smartlink/sso/login/zendesk) with the VTEX Support team.

Being open-source, the Store Framework also benefits from a community-driven support network. Users can request new features, report bugs, and engage with other developers via the [VTEX Community](https://community.vtex.com/), and follow updates in our [Release Notes](https://developers.vtex.com/updates/release-notes).
