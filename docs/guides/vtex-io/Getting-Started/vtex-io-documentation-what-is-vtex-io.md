VTEX IO is a low-code development platform designed to handle performance, scalability, and security requirements in enterprise applications. By managing infrastructure complexities, VTEX IO enables developers to concentrate on application logic and business-specific needs.

The platform supports a wide range of use cases, such as web storefronts, custom admin applications, and backend integrations.

## Cloud-native infrastructure

VTEX IO provides a cloud-native environment optimized for scalability and high availability, minimizing manual infrastructure management.

- **Automatic scaling:** Resources are dynamically adjusted based on traffic demands, maintaining uptime and performance even during peak usage without requiring pre-scaling.
- **VTEX IO Command-line interface (CLI):** The VTEX IO CLI enables fast setup and configuration, allowing developers to synchronize code with the cloud environment quickly and efficiently.
- **Continuous deployment:** Code changes in the local environment are automatically synced and deployed to the cloud, ensuring a consistent development and production environment.

## Workspaces

The [workspace](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-workspace) functionality on VTEX IO provides isolated environments, allowing teams to develop, test, and deploy code safely without impacting the live environment.

- **Version control:** Multiple workspaces allow developers to maintain and test separate code versions. Each workspace can be deployed independently to evaluate changes.
- **Testing and monitoring:** Workspaces support A/B testing and enable real-time performance tracking, allowing teams to measure the impact of updates and optimize them accordingly.

## Supported frameworks and technologies

VTEX IO incorporates an opinionated set of frameworks supported by [VTEX IO Builders](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-builders) to facilitate development with familiar tools. 

Supported frameworks include [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/), and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en).

### VTEX IO Store Framework

For teams specifically focused on building and maintaining storefronts, VTEX IO offers the [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework). This framework provides foundational tools and components, making it easy to create dynamic and customized ecommerce experiences.

- **React-based store blocks:** The Store Framework offers pre-built, customizable React [blocks]https://developers.vtex.com/docs/vtex-io-apps), which simplify the process of developing and updating storefront layouts and features.
- **Consistent architecture:** Designed to integrate seamlessly with other VTEX services, the Store Framework ensures stable, scalable storefronts that align with VTEXâ€™s core capabilities, supporting efficient and robust ecommerce solutions.
