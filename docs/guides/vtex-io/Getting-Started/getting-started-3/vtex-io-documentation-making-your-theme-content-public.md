A Store Theme is a VTEX IO app, meaning it operates like any other app, with built-in features such as versioning and deployment capabilities.

In this guide, you will find instructions to make your Store Theme available to end users.

## Instructions

If you are satisfied with the configurations youâ€™ve made and want your theme to be available to all users, follow the steps below:

1. [**Link**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-linking-an-app/) the theme to a [Development workspace](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-creating-a-development-workspace/) to test your changes.
2. [**Release**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-releasing-a-new-app-version/) the theme.
3. [**Publish**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-publishing-an-app/) it as a release candidate version.
4. [Install](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-installing-an-app/) the theme in a [**Production workspace**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-creating-a-production-workspace/) to test your changes with traffic.
5. [**Validate**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-publishing-an-app/) it as a release candidate if no more changes are needed. If changes to the theme are required, you should go back to step 1 and use a Development workspace. **Do not perform changes using a production workspace**.  
6. [**Deploy**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-publishing-an-app/) it as a stable version if you are sure about all the changes you performed.
7. [**Promote the Production workspace to Master**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-promoting-a-workspace-to-master/), finally making your theme public to your store's end users.
