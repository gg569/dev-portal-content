After making the first setups, creating your Store Theme project, and learning how to customize your store pages, you can begin personalizing your store more advancedly.

Under the [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework) category, you will find a set of guides to help you customize your storefront:

- [Building pages](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework-building-pages): Build various types of pages tailored to your business needs.
- [Using components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework-using-components): Build your storefront, from basic elements to advanced customizations, by leveraging VTEX IO Store Framework components.
- [Working with Site Editor](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework-working-with-site-editor): Customize your Store Framework storefront by using Site Editor.
- [Styling](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework-styling): Customize your store layout with Store Framework.

You can also access our [hands-on course on the VTEX Store Framework](https://learn.vtex.com/page/learning-path-lang-en).

> ℹ Once you’ve finished customizing your storefront, whether by completing the hands-on course or following our guides, keep in mind that your Store Theme app is still stored locally on your computer and it is linked to your VTEX store only through the development workspace. To make your changes visible to end users, you need to [make your theme content public](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-making-your-theme-content-public).
