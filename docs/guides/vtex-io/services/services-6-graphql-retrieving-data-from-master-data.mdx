Now that we have updated the product count, we need to retrieve the top N most viewed products. To do so, we can use Master Data to retrieve the product page view data and sort by the `count` field. We can also limit the length of retrieved products, creating a customized size rank of most-visited products.

To achieve this objective, we'll employ [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), the technology used by VTEX IO for data retrieval and interface between services and front-end applications. GraphQL allows implementing queries for fetching the exact data you need via types, schemas, and resolvers.

## Using the `graphql` builder

To enable the use of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) in your VTEX IO app, add the `graphql` builder to the app's `manifest.json` file.

```json service-course-template/manifest.json focus=8
{
  "name": "backend-course",
  "vendor": "vtex",
  "version": "0.0.2",
  "title": "Backend Course",
  "description": "Reference app for the Backend Course",
  "builders": {
    "graphql": "1.x",
    "node": "7.x"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "prereleasy": "bash lint.sh"
  },
  "credentialType": "absolute",
  "policies": [
    {
      "name": "ADMIN_DS"
    },
    {
      "name": "outbound-access",
      "attrs": {
        "host": "api.vtex.com",
        "path": "/dataentities/*"
      }
    }
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "vtex.events-example": "0.x"
  },
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtex/node-vtex-api/master/gen/manifest.schema"
}
```

---

## Creating the GraphQL type

Within the `service-course-template/graphql` folder, create a folder named `types`. Inside this folder, create the `productView.graphql` file to declare the type of the product list we intend to retrieve.

```graphql service-course-template/graphql/types/productView.graphql
type ProductView {
   slug: String
   count: Int
}
```

---

## Creating the GraphQL schema

Still within the `service-course-template/graphql` folder, define the schema in the `schema.graphql` file. This schema outlines the structure of our query and the data to be retrieved.

> Optionally, [directives](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#directives) can be included for scenarios like obtaining user tokens or utilizing cookies. Check out the [graphql-example](https://github.com/vtex-apps/graphql-example) app for advanced usage examples.

```graphql service-course-template/graphql/types/schema.graphql
type Query {
   productList(topN: Int): [ProductView]
}
```

---

## Creating the GraphQL resolver

With the schema, types, and query defined, create the query's resolver. The resolver determines the actions executed when a query is invoked. In our case, we want to perform a [scroll](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/search-and-scroll-api-queries) on Master Data, ordering by the count (to obtain the top most viewed products) and limiting the page size (the top N).

Back to our `node` implementation, define the resolver by creating a `node/resolvers` folder. In this new folder, add a file named `products.ts` and populate it with the code presented in the right panel.

```ts service-course-template/node/resolvers/products.ts
import { COURSE_ENTITY } from '../utils/constants'

export const productList = async (
 _: any,
 { topN }: { topN: number },
 { clients: { masterdata } }: Context
) =>
 masterdata
   .scrollDocuments({
     dataEntity: COURSE_ENTITY,
     fields: ['count', 'slug'],
     schema: 'v1',
     size: topN,
     sort: `count DESC`,
   })
   .then(({ data }) => data)
```

---

## Using the GraphQL resolver

Import the resolver into the `node/index.ts` file and set up the `graphql` section, connecting your defined queries with the underlying data retrieval logic (`productList`).

Note that resolvers act as the glue between your GraphQL schema and the actual data-fetching logic. When a GraphQL query is executed, the resolver associated with each field in the query is invoked to obtain the corresponding data. In this case, when the `productList` query is executed, the `productList` resolver function (`products.ts`) is triggered to fetch the top N most viewed products from Master Data.

```ts service-course-template/node/index.ts focus=12,56:62
import {
  LRUCache,
  Service,
  ServiceContext,
  ParamsContext,
  RecorderState,
  method,
} from '@vtex/api'
import { Clients } from './clients'
import { analytics } from './handlers/analytics'
import { updateLiveUsers } from './event/liveUsersUpdate'
import { productList } from './resolvers/products'

// Create a LRU memory cache for the Status client.
// The @vtex/api HttpClient respects Cache-Control headers and uses the provided cache.
const memoryCache = new LRUCache<string, any>({ max: 5000 })
metrics.trackCache('status', memoryCache)

declare global {
  type Context = ServiceContext<Clients, State>

  interface State extends RecorderState {
    code: number
  }
}

const THREE_SECONDS_MS = 3 * 1000
const CONCURRENCY = 10

export default new Service<Clients, State, ParamsContext>({
  clients: {
    implementation: Clients,
    options: {
      default: {
        retries: 2,
        timeout: 10000,
      },
      events: {
        exponentialTimeoutCoefficient: 2,
        exponentialBackoffCoefficient: 2,
        initialBackoffDelay: 50,
        retries: 1,
        timeout: THREE_SECONDS_MS,
        concurrency: CONCURRENCY,
      },
    },
  },
  events: {
    liveUsersUpdate: updateLiveUsers,
  },
  routes: {
    analytics: method({
      GET: [analytics],
    }),
  },
  graphql: {
    resolvers: {
      Query: {
        productList,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

## Linking the app

Finally, run `vtex link` and access the provided GraphQL route.
