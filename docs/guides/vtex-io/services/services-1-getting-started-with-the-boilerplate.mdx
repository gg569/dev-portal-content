The first thing you need to do is clone the [service-course-template](https://github.com/vtex-trainings/service-course-template) boilerplate, which is a template repository that we provide with all the initial files that you need to get started in this course.

Follow the step-by-step instructions to get started with the boilerplate and its dependencies.

<CH.Scrollycoding>

## Cloning the boilerplate repository

Clone the `service-course-template` boilerplate by running the command presented in the left. This will create a local copy of the project, equipping you with the necessary files to start the course.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/vtex-trainings/service-course-template
```

## Understanding the app structure

Open the [service-course-template](https://github.com/vtex-trainings/service-course-template) project in the code editor of your preference. You will notice the project contains three directories (`/docs`, `/node` and `/graphql`), the `manifest.json` file and the `package.json` file.

```txt
root
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ docs
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ node
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ graphql
 â”£ ðŸ“„ README.md
 â”£ ðŸ“„ manifest.json
 â”— ðŸ“„ package.json
```

---

### `manifest.json` file

At the heart of this structure lies the [`manifest.json`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-manifest) file, a crucial document encapsulating metadata about the app. This file not only contains fundamental details such as the app's `name`, `version`, and `title` but also outlines the `builders`, `policies`, and `dependencies` necessary for the app functionality. Let's delve deeper into some of these concepts:

| Field | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
|`builders` | `object` | Specifies the [builders](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-builders) required by the app. Note that the app uses the `node` builder, which is responsible for interpreting [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) code. For each declared builder, there will be a dedicated folder specifically designed to be interpreted by that particular builder. |
| `policies` | `array` | Declares [policies](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-policies) for accessing external services or specific resources needed for the app functioning. |
|`dependencies` | `object` | Lists other VTEX IO apps on which the app relies. For example, the app is dependent on the [events-example](https://github.com/vtex-apps/events-example) app, which we will use in the following steps to trigger events.  |

<CH.Code show={["manifest.json"]}>

```json manifest.json focus=7:9,14:17
{
  "name": "backend-course",
  "vendor": "vtex",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "title": "Backend Course",
  "description": "Reference app for the Backend Course",
  "builders": {
    "node": "7.x"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "prereleasy": "bash lint.sh"
  },
  "credentialType": "absolute",
  "policies": [],
  "dependencies": {
    "vtex.events-example": "0.x"
  },
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtex/node-vtex-api/master/gen/manifest.schema"
}
```

</CH.Code>

### `/node` folder

The `/node` folder houses the backend logic of the app, written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Here, Node packages and native libraries, such as [`@vtex/clients`](https://github.com/vtex/io-clients), can be employed to enhance code development.

In this project, our Node code is organized as in the following:

| Folder or file | Description |
| - | - |
| `/node/clients` | Holds placeholder files for implementing custom [VTEX IO clients](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-clients). |
| `/node/handlers` | Contains handler functions and logic designed to handle specific tasks and events. |
| `/node/utils` | Holds global constants declarations (`/node/constants.ts`) and other utility fuctions. |
| `/node/index.ts` | Encompasses initial declarations for app functionality, such as cache and service declarations. This file will evolve throughout the course and also allow for the export of resolver function implementations for GraphQL. |
| `/node/service.json` | Describes the behavior of the service and attributes that impact the app's infrastructure. |

Note that most of the directories are empty and will be filled throughout this course.

#### `service.json` file

Located within the `/node` folder, the [`service.json`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-service) file configures the app's infrastructure attributes. Key details are summarized in the following table:

| Field | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `memory` | `integer` | Memory size allocated to the app, in megabytes. This value is subjective to automatic adjustments if excessive usage is detected. |
| `timeout` | `integer` | Maximum duration for fulfilling a request, in seconds. Requests exceeding this timeout are aborted. |
| `minReplicas` | `integer` | Minimum number of replicas available when the app is operational. |
| `maxReplicas` | `integer` | Maximum numbers of replicas available for the app. |
| `routes` | `object` | Describes the app's REST routes. |

```json node/service.json
{
  "memory": 256,
  "timeout": 2,
  "minReplicas": 2,
  "maxReplicas": 4,
  "routes": {
    "status": {
      "path": "/_v/status/:code",
      "public": true
    }
  }
}
```

### `/graphql` folder

The `/graphql` folder, though currently empty, will be used to house GraphQL-related files in the project. The `/graphql/schema.graphql` file is a common convention for storing the GraphQL schema definition. In a GraphQL schema, you define the types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions that your GraphQL service supports. As our app evolves, we will populate this file with our GraphQL schema.
