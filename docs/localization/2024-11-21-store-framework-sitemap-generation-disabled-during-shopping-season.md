To ensure the reliability and stability of our services during the high-demand Shopping Season 2024, the generation of routes within the [Sitemap](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.store-sitemap) will be disabled temporarily.

>ℹ️ This disablement impacts only Store Framework stores.

## When will the disablement occur?

- **Start date:** Tuesday, November 26th
- **End date:** Tuesday, December 3rd

## Why did we make this change?

Generating routes is resource-intensive and may overload catalog-related services during high-demand periods like the Shopping Season. This process increases the demand for additional rewriter replicas to handle Sitemap requests and results in higher CPU usage in databases.

## What needs to be done?

No action is needed.
