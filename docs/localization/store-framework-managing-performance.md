The performance of your website directly impacts the overall business success. Fast-loading websites provide a smoother shopping experience, keep users engaged, and reduce bounce rates. On the other hand, poor performance, such as slow load times, may lead to frustrated users and lost sales.

Site performance is also a key factor in SEO rankings, which influences organic traffic and visibility in search engines. Learn more in the [SEO](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/storefront-seo) guide.

In this section, you will learn how to optimize your website performance by configuring key settings in your Store Framework store.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Have a Store Framework store

Make sure your store has a [Store Theme](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-store-theme) developed following the [Getting Started](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/getting-started-3) tutorial.

Customize your store theme according to your business needs, following the guides within the [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework) section, such as [Building pages](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/building-pages) and [Using components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/using-components) guides.

### Check the builders

Check if the builders are properly installed in your Store Theme. To use builders, your account must have at least version `vtex.builder-hub@0.293.4` installed. Also, you need to specify them in the app's manifest.json file. Learn more in [Builders](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-builders).

### Learn about performance best practices

Familiarize yourself with the best practices and tools for optimizing your store performance. Learn more in the [Performance](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/storefront-performance) guide.
