The FastStore SDK is a toolkit that provides functions and interfaces for managing the state of key ecommerce features in the browser context. By providing a set of functions and interfaces, it simplifies tasks like tracking cart items and handling user sessions.

The SDK is organized into four modules, each with specific properties and behaviors. This track provides more details about each module.

- [Shopping cart](#shopping-cart)
- [Session](#session)
- [Search](#search)
- [Analytics](#analytics)

## Shopping cart

The Cart module controls the state of the shopping cart data structure in the shopper's browser. You can use them to add items to the cart, remove items, and clear the cart, among other tasks. Learn more about [shopping cart functions](LINK).
