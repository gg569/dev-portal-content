# Best practices for writing documentation

At VTEX, the goal of documentation is to make everything as simple and clear as possible so everyone can understand how to use a product.

Before contributing to the documentation, make sure to follow these guidelines:

- [Best practices for writing documentation](#best-practices-for-writing-documentation)
  - [Define the documentation objectives](#define-the-documentation-objectives)
    - [Identifying the audience](#identifying-the-audience)
    - [Checklist to define the documentation objectives](#checklist-to-define-the-documentation-objectives)
  - [Documentation style guide](#documentation-style-guide)
    - [Style guide principles](#style-guide-principles)

## Define the documentation objectives

Before you start writing, it is important to understand your target audience and the specific goals of your documentation. To help you define the documentation objectives, answer the following questions:

- What do you want users to achieve after reading your documentation?

- What are the essential tasks or concepts they need to understand?

- Is there any additional information that might be helpful but not strictly necessary? If so, consider placing it in a separate section or article.

### Identifying the audience

To help you define the audience, answer the following questions:

- Who will be reading your content?
- What are they trying to do?

At VTEX, we have the following audience as our documentation readers:
