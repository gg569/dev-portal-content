---

If you need to update the [`@fastore/cli`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#packagejson) package, follow these instructions.

1. Open your FastStore codebase in the code editor of your preference.

2. Open the terminal and run the following:

    ```bash
    yarn add @faststore/cli@latest
    ```

3. The following message will appear:

```bash
error Running this command will add the dependency to the workspace root rather than the workspace itself, which might not be what you want - if you really meant it, make it explicit by running this command again with the -W flag (or --ignore-workspace-root-check).
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/add for documentation about this command.
```

4. Run the `yarn add @faststore/cli@latest` command again and add the `-W` flag:

```bash
yarn add @faststore/cli@latest -W
```

5. Run `yarn dev` to sync the changes to your project.
